    <div class = "subtitle"><h2>Interest in IT </h2></div>>


<div class = "pgraphs"><p>I started to get interested in IT when I was in my early 14s  when I was trying to see what job suits me
through Seek and the first 15 answers were all IT and the salary was high. I tried to learn a few 
Program languages through Khan Academy and I found it fun so when I applied to go to University, I
Chose to go for a bachelor of IT.</p></div>>

<div class ="subtitle"><h2>Ideal Job:</h2></div>

<div class = "pgraphs"><p>

    The Ideal Job I would like to go for in an IT career is Data Analysis. They get paid at least $100,000 a 
    year.
    
    A general Data analyst gathers and analyses business data whether it is finances, patients, sales. The
    applications are wide in scope.
    
    The Specific field I was keen on exploring is Quants. I find this field appealing because I am an avid
    mathematician. Quants involve mathematical modelling through IT applications through coding and 
    Algorithms. It also involves researching on historical data so that in the future, the business can get 
    more profit.
